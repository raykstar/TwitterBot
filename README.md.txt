This is a fun experiment on automated twitter bots. The run the bot.py file to send automatic replies to anyone who tweets @you.



Note:
You need to install Python 3.x and tweepy to run this python file.



Note:
You need to generate conusmer api key, consumer  api secret key, access token and access token secret which are the user access token from Twitter.

Where can you get tweepy?

I am glad you asked. Tweepy is an open-source, easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API.

Get it here:
https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy

Or maybe just type 

pip install tweepy

in your CLI


PS: I might add other utilities in the future.
PPS: You account might get blocked if you spam. Wield this power wisely.
